# Hi there, I'm Roshan! ðŸ‘‹


## About Me

I am currently a PhD researcher at MMSB, CNRS, Lyon. My research interests are in the computational modeling of biological macromolecules and nanomaterials, employing biophysical principles and molecular dynamics simulations to understand complex molecular systems and their interactions at the nanoscale.

## Skills

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, C++, Fortran
- **Databases:** MySQL

## Projects

Here are a few projects I have worked on:

- [Martini 3 Fullerene](https://github.com/MoMS-MMSB/Martini3-Fullerene): Generates a Martini 3 model of Fullerene for running the molecular dynamics simulation with the Gromacs simulation package. The script outputs both the structure file (.gro) and a topology file (.itp).
- [Martini 3 Graphene](): Generates a Martini 3 model of both finite and infinite graphene sheet for running the molecular dynamics simulation with the Gromacs simulation package. The script outputs both the structure file (.gro) and a topology file (.itp).
